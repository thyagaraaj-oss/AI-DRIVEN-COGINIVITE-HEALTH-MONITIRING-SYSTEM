A hybrid deep learning model combines GLCM texture features with LSTM/CNN-LSTM to enhance early prediction of neurodegenerative diseases and aneurysms from brain MRI. GLCM highlights subtle structural changes, while LSTM captures progression patterns. This integrated approach improves accuracy and enables scalable, non-invasive diagnosis.
